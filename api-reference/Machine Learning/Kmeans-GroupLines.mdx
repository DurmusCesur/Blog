title: 'Kmeans - GroupLines'
description: '
But what happens when we don’t know the distances between geometries, or when those distances vary? In this scenario, K-Means can be used much like DBSCAN -except that you simply define how many clusters you want. It’s also one of the easiest ways to deal with a messy .dwg file.-


K-means is possible to group geometry , relying solely on the density, spatial continuity, and neighborhood relationships of the existing points.


What makes this approach powerful:

- Linear arrangements and disconnected areas naturally separate themselves

- The grouping logic remains intact even when the plan is revised


This is not a scheme forced by rules, but an organization learned directly from the space itself.'
