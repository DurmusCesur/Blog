title: 'NearestNeighbors - GroupWalls'
description: '
 When you don’t know the exact distances between geometries and all you want is to find the geometries that are adjacent to a given reference, classical clustering methods such as K-Means or DBSCAN may not always be the right tools. What we actually need to look at is simply the “adjacency relationships.”


By using NearestNeighbors, it is possible to group geometries by directly querying spatial proximity. Given a set of reference geometries, it identifies only the surrounding geometries—without relying on a fixed distance threshold or a predefined clustering logic.


What makes this approach powerful:

- Linear arrangements and disconnected regions are naturally separated.

- The grouping logic remains consistent even when the layout changes.

- No assumptions are required about scale or spacing.


This is not a rule-based scheme imposed from the outside.
 It is an organization learned directly from spatial relationships.
