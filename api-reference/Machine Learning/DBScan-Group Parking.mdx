title: 'DBScan - Group Parking'
description: '
It is possible to group parking spaces in a plan without any predefined data, relying solely on the density, spatial continuity, and neighborhood relationships of the existing points.



What makes this approach powerful:

- Linear arrangements and disconnected areas naturally separate themselves

- The grouping logic remains intact even when the plan is revised


This is not a scheme forced by rules, but an organization learned directly from the space itself.
